<!-- # My Custom macOS Setup (Sequoia 15.4+)

## General Information & Philosophy

- This description/readme is just an overview. For all the details please check the dotfiles directly, which get updated very often üò¨
- The following applies throughout: `alt = opt(ion)` and hotkeys = shortcuts.
- I only used Windows and Linux all my life - until April 2024. Back then I bought my first MacBook; and since then I am continuously work on my setup, which now I want to share here.
- I do not use macOS' hiding or minimizing at all, which is why I 'deactivated' the correspoding hotkeys completely ([see below](#anchor1)).
- I use my Dock at the left side with nothing in there beside the two not-removable stock items Finder and Trash. It is set to autohide with no delay ([Onyx](https://titanium-software.fr/en/onyx.html) or using a terrminal command).
- For my mouse setup I use [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)'s [mouse support features[(https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Configuration#mouse-support) as well as [Linearmouse](https://linearmouse.app/). Every mouse with the widely available "5 buttons layout" will work.
- Everywhere I can I use cable versions of my peripherals or even devices in general, since personally the general wireless hype makes mostly no sense to me: Batteries die, are bad for the environment and the performance is always worse than with their cable counterparts. And I don't care if there is a cable from my keyboard, mouse, speaker, headphones or ... to my computer or the according device(s) involved. As long as all cables are well managed I am happy. Honestly.. I like the look of well organized cables more than no cables.
- I don't like using [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) or [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) or something similar since the corresponding inbuilt features like Spotlight and macOS' own Emoji Picker etc are good enough for me.  
  Tipp: Spotlight in use with DuckDuckGo as your default search engine gives you the ability to write for example "yt! Queens of the Stone Age Paper Machete" and by clicking `cmd - b` it will open your default brwoser with the corresponding results on Youtube. There are many such "shebangs" for DuckDuckGo.  
  Another tipp: macOS' Emoji Picker is faster if you use it with the stock hotkey `ctrl + cmd - space` or any other custom hotkey other than macOS' "**Press üåê key to**" function. My guess is, that the system needs time to check if you are holding or pressing Globe/fn and therefore there occurs this slight delay so many are annoyed by. Using it with another dedicated hotkey isn't as fast as [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)'s Emoji Picker, but fast enough for me.

## Keyboard Setup

I use a Keychron Q1 (V1, ISO Germany) as my external keyboard beside my laptop when I'm at home since 2022. The qmk keymap I use for macOS (slightly adjusted for readability) is  -->

## Keyboard Setup

I use a Keychron Q1 (V1, ISO Germany) as my external keyboard beside my laptop when I'm at home since 2022. The qmk keymap I use for macOS (slightly adjusted for readability) is

```
which is meant to mimic the inbuilt keyboard with its layout as best as possible.

#### Remarks

1. In `System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts... > Modifier Keys` I change _Control_ to _Globe/fn_ and _Caps Lock_ to _Control_ for both the inbuilt and the external keyboard. Therefore from now on `CAPS` will be replaced with `CTRL` and `C(____)` with `FN(____)`.
2. To imitate the special functions of the f-row completely with the inbuilt keyboard I use the following three lines in my [Skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) config (skhdrc).  
    ```
    f15 : skhd -k "0xB1" # spotlight
    f16 : skhd -k "0xB0" # dictation
    f17 : skhd -k "0xB2" # do not disturb
    ```
3. The additional keys on the far right of the Q1 I use as follows:
    ```
                               F13      F14
                                        MPLY
                                        MPRV

    `f14` : mute ([Switchaudio-OSX](https://github.com/deweller/switchaudio-osx))
    
    `fn - f13` = `shift - f13` : toggle my desklight on/off (**Curl** w/ElgatoKeylight)
    
    `fn - f14` = `shift - f14` : open/close room correction software ([Sonarworks SoundID Reference](https://www.sonarworks.com/soundid-reference))
    
    `fn - f15` = `shift - f15` : dedicated global play/pause button for music player ([Foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/mac))

    `fn + alt - f17` = `shift + alt - f17` : turn mic on (RME TotalMix FX)
    
4. The option "Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys" in `System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts... > Function Keys` I can easily toggle with an according [SketchyBar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar) item ([see below](#anchor2)). This only affects the inbuilt keyboard, which honestly is a feature and not a bug in my specific case.

## Hotkeys

Since the _Control_ key has basically no function in macOS other than inside the Terminal I use it as my main "appswitcher-key" and for other stuff, which I'll come to later, while dedicating the few system functions & features which use the _Control_ key in macOS' stock config to other hotkeys.  
And while using  
```
.blacklist [
"Ghostty"
"iTerm2"
"Terminal"
"Windows App"
]
```
in my skhdrc I ensure a functioning _Control_ key where I need it.

My goal is to have a few modifiers (or modifier-pairs) which together with the available "action keys" control my whole system in kind of a layer-like setup:  
`Control`, `Option + Command`, `Option`, `Command` and `Globe/fn`  
That's in theory not at all different from the goal of basically every keyboard usage or "layout", I agree, but having your own system and building it "from the ground" up seemed logical to me, since I myself can choose placements, priorities and modifier layering and depth; while making it very easy for me to experiment, maintain and bugfix quickly (for which I use a specific VS Code Workspace with the file structure this repo has).  
Another benefit of this is that one basically doesn't have to achingly remember hotkeys as usual, because choosing and setting them up does half the job for you imho.  

One main feature of the whole setup is that the mouse follows the focus and also the focus follows the mouse, which makes everything super fast. ([Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) & [AltTab](https://github.com/lwouis/alt-tab-macos))

<a id="anchor1"></a>  

Many of the stock macOS' hotkeys I have either deactivated directly in `System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts...` or I overwrote them with [Skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) either with new functions or with `return`, e.g.: `alt + cmd - h : return # hide others` <!-- `fn + shift - a : return # show launchpad` -->

I will now list some important hotkey-categories with a selection of their according hotkeys - to get an idea of the "system" - where I deliberately don't list all the ones you can find (and/or the intricacies behind the ones shown) in the dotfiles, because they are mostly too specific to me and my peculiar setup. Features that are basically stock in macOS but mostly remapped I will write **Capitalized And Bold**.  
All this (obviously) heavily relies and is based on [Skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) and [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) as well as some bash scripting; if other apps are used to achieve the mentioned function/feature/behavior they are mentioned in parentheses.  

#### Remark

I don't use  [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)'s tiling feature, instead I just use the floating window management.  

> Why don't you use the newly available inbuilt window management features of macOS then?

Because they are, like the switching of spaces (virtual desktops), way too slow for me because of their animations which cannot be disabled completely.  
Warning: To use [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) to its fullest one has to deactivate SIP (e.g. for fast space switching).

### Window Management ###

```
                                 ...
                                 ...

_ADD THE REST OF THE KEPT MACOS HOTKEYS TOO! perhaps even more from other programs/apps?_

### Mouse and Trackpad Actions & Gestures

`forwards_button/backwards_button` : "universal back and forward" ([Linearmouse](https://linearmouse.app/))

`ctrl - right_button` : resize window ([Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai))

`cmd - right_button` : left menubar content ([Menuwhere](https://manytricks.com/menuwhere/))

`alt - forwards_button` : smart zoom ([Linearmouse](https://linearmouse.app/)) (only mouse)

`alt - backwards_button` : `cmd - 0` = often zooms out ([Linearmouse](https://linearmouse.app/))  (only mouse)

`alt + cmd - left_button` = `alt + cmd - left_arrow` : often moves to the tab on the left ([Linearmouse](https://linearmouse.app/)) (only mouse)

`alt + cmd - right_button` = `alt + cmd - right_arrow` : often moves to the tab on the right ([Linearmouse](https://linearmouse.app/)) (only mouse)

`three-finger-up` : **Mission Control** (only trackpad)

`three-finger-down` : **App Expos√©** (only trackpad)

### Caveats

- **Display/Monitor-Setups** : only designed for maximal two displays, the internal and one external display with 27"1440p (to the left); and a new or different external monitor would need a few adaptions and/or changes.
- **Dependencies** : many Apps are needed and mentioned all over this readme. Most of them can comfortably be downloaded via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). They are all free except of [Menuwhere](https://manytricks.com/menuwhere/) (3$). <!-- cliclick, jq, ... [all available on Homebrew] ... yabai, skhd, keysmith, onlyswitch, menuwhere, linearmouse, alttab, ... (check references again), -->

# My Custom macOS Setup (Sequoia 15.4+)

## General Information

- This description/readme is just an overview, for all the details please check the dotfiles directly, which get updated very often ðŸ˜¬
- The following applies throughout: `alt = opt(ion)`
- I used only Windows and Linux all my life - until April 2024 when I bought my first MacBook. Since then I am continuously working on my setup and now I want to share the process here.
- I do not use macOS' hiding or minimizing at all, which is why I 'deactivated' the correspoding hotkeys completely (see below).
- I use my Dock at the left side with nothing in there beside the two not-removable stock items Finder and Trash. It is set to autohide with no delay.
- For my mouse setup I use [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)'s mouse support features as well as Linearmouse. Every mouse with the widely available 5 buttons layout will work.
- Everywhere I can I use cable versions of my peripherals (or practically devices overall), since personally the wireless hype of the last years makes mostly no sense to me: Batteries die, are bad for the enviroment and the performance is always worse than with their cable counterparts. And I don't care if there is a cable from my keyboard, mouse, speaker, headphones or ... to my computer or the according device(s) involved. As long as all cables are well managed in my setup I am happy. Honestly I like the look of well organized cables more than no cables.
- I don't like using [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) or [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) or something similar since the corresponding inbuilt features like Spotlight and macOS' own Emoji Picker etc are good enough for me. Tipp: Spotlight in use with DuckDuckGo as your default search engine gives you the ability to write for example "yt! Queens of the Stone Age Paper Machete" and by clicking `cmd - b` it will open your default brwoser with the corresponding results on Youtube. There are many such "shebangs" for DuckDuckGo.

## Keyboard Setup

I use a Keychron Q1 (V1, ISO Germany) as my external keyboard beside my laptop since 2022. The qmk keymap I use for macOS (slightly optimized for readability) is  
```
ESC               F1       F2       F3       F4       F5       F6       F7       F8       F9       F10      F11      F12      F13      F14

```
which is meant to mimic the inuilt keyboard with its layout as best as possible.

### Remarks

1. In `System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts... > Modifier Keys` I change _Control_ to _Globe/fn_ and _Caps Lock_ to _Control_ for both the inbuilt and the external keyboard. Therefore from now on `CAPS` will be replaced with `CTRL` and `C(____) & ctrl +/- ...` with `FN(____) & fn +/- ...`.
2. To imitate the special functions of the f-row completely with the inbuilt keyboard I use the following three lines in my [Skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) config.  
    ```
    f15 : skhd -k "0xB1" # spotlight
    f16 : skhd -k "0xB0" # dictation
    f17 : skhd -k "0xB2" # do not disturb
    ```
3. The additional keys on the far right of the Q1 I use as follows
    ```
                               F13      F14
                                        MPLY
                                        MPRV
                                        MNXT
    
    RALT     FN

                                        S(F15)
                                        S(F16)
                                        S(F17)
    
    
    ```
    where 
    
    `f13` : toggle my inbuilt macbook display on/off (Brightness)
    
    `f14` : mute (SwitchAudioSource)
    
    `fn - f13` = `shift - f13` : toggle my desklight on/off (curl/Elgato)
    
    `fn - f14` = `shift - f14` : open/close room correction software (Sonarworks SoundID Reference)
    
    `fn - f15` = `shift - f15` : dedicated global play/pause button for music player (Foobar2000)
    
    `fn - f16` = `shift - f16` : send midi message to change audio output to my speaker (Sendmidi)
    
    `fn - f17` = `shift - f17` : send midi message to change audio output to my headphones (Sendmidi)
    
    `fn + alt - f13` = `shift + alt - f13` : show/hide menubar ([Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai))
    
    `fn + alt - f14` = `shift + alt - f14` : open/close digital audio mixer RME TotalMix FX
    
    `fn + alt - f15` = `shift + alt - f15` : turn guitar setup on (RME TotalMix FX)
    
    `fn + alt - f16` = `shift + alt - f16` : turn guitar and mic off (RME TotalMix FX)
    
    `fn + alt - f17` = `shift + alt - f17` : turn mic on (RME TotalMix FX)
    
4. The option 'Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys' in `System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts... > Function Keys` I can easily toggle with an according [Sketchybar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar) item (see below). This only affects the inbuilt keybaord, which honestly is a feature and not a bug in my specfic case.

## Hotkeys / Shortcuts

Since the _Control_ key has basically no function in macOS other than the Terminal I use it as my main "appswitcher-key" and for other stuff, which I'll come to later, while dedicating the few system functions & features which use the _Control_ key in macOS' stock config to other hotkeys/shortcuts and while using  
```
.blacklist [
"Ghostty"
"iTerm2"
"Terminal"
"Windows App"
]
```
in my skhdrc to ensure a functioning _Control_ key where I need it.

My goal was/is to have a few modifiers (or modifier-pairs) which together with the available "action keys" control my whole system in kind of a layer-like setup:  
`Control`, `Option + Command`, `Option`, `Command` and `Globe/fn`  
That's in theory not that different from the goal of basically every keyboard usage/layout, I agree, but having your own system and building it "from the ground" up seemed logical to me, since I myself can choose placements, priorities and modifier layering / depth while making it very easy for me to experiment, maintain and bugfix quickly (for which I use a specific VS Code Workspace with the file structure this repo has).
Another benefit from this is that one basically doesn't have to achingly remember hotkeys and shortcuts like normally, because choosing and setting them up does half the job for you imho.

Many of the stock macOS' hotkeys/shortcuts I have either deactivated directly in `System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts...` or I overwrote them with [Skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) either with new functions or with `return`, e.g.:  
`fn + shift - a : return # show launchpad`

I will now list some important hotkey categories with a selection of their according hotkeys - to get an idea of the 'system' - where I deliberately don't list all the ones you can find (and/or the intricacies behind the ones shown) in the dotfiles, because they are mostly too specific to me and my peculiar setup. Features that are basically stock in macOS but mostly remapped I will write **Capitalized And Bold**.
All this (obiously) heavily relies and is based on [Skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) and [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) as well as some bash scripting; if other apps are used to achieve the mentioned function/feature/behavior they are mentioned in paranthesis.

### Caveats

- **Display/Monitor-Setups** : only designed for maximal two displays, the internal and one external display with 27"1440p (to the left); and a new or different external monitor would need a few adaptions/changes.
- **Dependencies** : many Apps are needed and mentioned all over this readme. Most of them can comfortably be downloaded via Homebrew. They are all free except of Menuwhere (3$). <!-- cliclick, jq, ... [all available on Homebrew] ... yabai, skhd, keysmith, onlyswitch, menuwhere, linearmouse, alttab, ...
